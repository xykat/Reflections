it helped to find the exact line where the change was there 
it also helped find where additions were made or where substractions were made
it was quicker to perform

it can let me add or remove pieces of code from a different time
allow me to branch out from a particular previous version to try new functions and see its effects
it lets me see what was done to a file when and follow the logic in which changes were made in that file

-What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros:
Under our control- can be made logical
manageable number of commits

Cons:
Human error in forgetting to commit

-Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Becuase in Git file dependency is essential. One part of code changed can affect the other parts too - so its necessary to allow saving multiple files in one commit. Google docs however deal with only one file at a time with no file dependency so mutiple svaing is no required.

-How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows all previous commits and helps us see all the old versions of the code repository
git diff shows actual differences between the previous versions chosen in the command

-How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
i can checkout old versions to find where a bug was introduced also see how previous versions were performing vs. present versions.

-Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
After setting workspace i want to see how setting up helps me better than before. I think i would have been able to do the work even without setting this up; so curious to find out how is this helpful
