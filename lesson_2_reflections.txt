What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing allows us to start tracking the directory. It creates a .git file in the folder (or repository) where all the metadata about new changes is stored.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory is the directory in hard drive where the files are present.
Repository is the Git collections of commit.
Staging area is the intermediate virtual directory where we add collection of files that will be edited and added in the repository as a single commit corresponding to one logical change.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By using 'git add' you can add just the necessary files for the logical change to staging area and commit them accordingly.
