When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When i want my work to be accessible anywhere online. When there are multiple people wokring on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
That is a safe way to ensure only the correct and meaningful changes are reflected in github. It allows the person to add comments to any logical change that is made. It also avoids sync-ing of incomplete code which would'nt compile later.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork: To copy/clone someone's repository to ones account where you do not have the permission to change other's repository.
Clone: To create another copy of the repository
Branch: To create a point from where the code can be written in seperate ways withing a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It gives us an idea of how much have we progressed offline and out of reach of github(and other users)
